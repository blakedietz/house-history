### Concrete estimate from Mr. Mudd

#### Description

A gentleman from Mr. Mudd came to the house to give us an estimate on the concrete.  This includes the front of the garage, car port and asphalt replacement.  An estimate was emailed to us coming in at $12,962 (sent on 7/21/20).  If we pay within 7 days of the proposed estimate, we could save 4% which brings the cost down to $12,444.

### Kitchen drain was clogged

#### Description

Again the drain was clogged. It was bad enough this time that we didn't catch the blockage before we ran the dish washer. Unfortunately the dish washer overflowed due to the blockage. There was a pool of water in front of the dish washer in the kitchen.

We had A+ cleaning and draining come out and they roto routed the clog out. We haven't had issues since.

### Kitchen drain was cloggged

#### Description

Shortly after having the disposal installed the sink drain in the kitchen started clogging.

### Had disposal wiring looked at

Service provider: Same day electric

#### Description

After having the disposal installed we realized that for some reason the switch to the disposal that was already wired wasn't working. We had the electrician come out and take a look. It was nothing major, the wiring was poorly done though so one of the nuts had come loose which caused the issue. He cleaned up the wiring to make it make a bit more sense and then got the disposal wiring working.

### Installed disposal

Service provider: A+ Plumbing Drain Cleaning and Plumbing LLC

#### Description

We had the disposal installed on the left hand side. We decided to get this done at the same time while they were looking at the water hammer to cut down on osts.

### Had water hammer looked at

Service provider: A+ Plumbing Drain Cleaning and Plumbing LLC

#### Description

Over the last year we were noticing a banging noise that would take place about 30-45 seconds after flushing. This turned out to be due to a couple of issues. A water hammer effect along with a poor selection of a serires of 90 degree joints in the plumbing under the house.

While we had the plumbers going under the house they ended up mentioning a few things:

- There were a strange series of 90 degree joints under the water softener. The work there didn't make much sense.
- The piping under the house was galvanized. We already knew this from the inspection and it's no surpirse due to the age of the house.
- The piping under the house was made of two separate materials copper and then the galvanized pipe. If the two pipes were not put together with a proper coupler a reaction causing a current and in turn degredation of the piping could happen.

I asked about how much it would cost to have them come out and revamp the plumbing in the house. They mentioned around 3500 in estimate to revamp the plumbingall the way to the city connection.

### Installed Ring floodlight

#### Description

Installed a flood light under the cover of the carport.

We found out that there is a junction box installed in the area. It is a bit further back so you'll need longer screws. It uses a #8 machined screw. We used a #8 machined screw that's 2 inches long. We found out that the previous owners seemed to have used a drill gun to remove the aluminum siding. The cut isn't very smooth.

### Installed Ring smart doorbell

#### Description

Installed a smart doorbell in the front of the house. Found out we have 24v power going to the front.

The circuit for the doorbell is mapped to the Kitchen O. light switch.

### Electricity went out because of hall light setup

Service provider: United Electric Contracting, Inc.

#### Description

Electricity went out in three separate areas of the house:

- Guest bedroom
- Bathroom
- Hallway light switch

It turns out that nothing major happened. The wiring for the aforementioned locations is located within the light. Something came loose and caused the lighting for those three areas to go out. The electrician just had to tweak some of the wires that were in some wire nuts.

### Old air conditioner disconnect

#### Description

The air conditioner seemingly stopped working after installing a smart thermostat. It turned out that the disconnect (big ass switch) next to the the air conditioner was just old and wasn't connecting the leads to the circuit in the switch. We jumped the leads for a day and then had the air conditioner servicer come out and fix the disconnect.

### Updated the thermostat

#### Description

Added Ecobee thermostat to the house.
